A task:

    Independent control flow
    internal state
    can be scheduled (suspended/resumed)
    can communicate with other tasks


In a real operating system, traps are how
application programs request the services of
the operating system (syscalls)

Application programs are not strongly linked
to the OS kernel (traps are only interface)
